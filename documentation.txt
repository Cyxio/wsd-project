Welcome to Healthalyzerâ„¢!

In order to run the program, the user must fill in the database credentials and also create the required tables in the database.
The credentials are to be inserted in the '.env' file, so that they will be loaded as environmental variables.
.env file also contains a variable that is required for testing, the TEST_ENVIRONMENT variable.

The necessary CREATE TABLE sql queries are found in the executedQueries.txt. The first four queries allow for the program to be
run locally with all features. The last four queries are required for setting up testing tables, which are used in tests.js.

Running the application:
1. Fill out PGHOST, PGDATABASE, PGUSER, PGPASSWORD and PGPORT.
2. Check that TEST_ENVIRONMENT="false".
3. Use the first 4 queries from executedQueries.txt (CREATE TABLE, CREATE UNIQUE INDEX, CREATE TABLE, CREATE TABLE)
4. Run using "deno run --allow-net --allow-env --allow-read --unstable app.js"

When you wish run the tests for the application, change the TEST_ENVIRONMENT to "true" in .env (TEST_ENVIRONMENT="true").
Remember to run the additional 4 queries in executedQueries.txt to create testing tables.

After that, run using "deno test --allow-net --allow-env --allow-read --unstable tests/tests.js".

The application is also available online at https://wsd-project-healthalyzer.herokuapp.com/ for testing.

Disclaimer: Creating and examining database entries close to midnight might cause some issues, as not all html elements 
and java Date() objects take timezones/daylight savings into account correctly.
